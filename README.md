Welcome to my Forex Website!

In order to login type "1" on every input.

When "logged in" you will be redirected to the main page where you have two Drop Down Lists that are loaded by the Excel in the project (you might have to change the path for it to work, you can also use a method that I have "LoadFilesHardcoded()" that has some hardcoded
currencies to load on the list to test.
I am also using IronXL for the excel read which is a paid app that I have a trial version just for this project. The license key in on the Program.cs line 2.

In the Models of both pages, Index and MaindPage, you can find some comments to explain the code.

Thanks!
